The `ChatGPT UI Preview` tool serves the purpose of efficiently previewing user interfaces generated from ChatGPT's code, primarily focusing on HTML and CSS. By providing a streamlined way to visualize the UI output, it significantly reduces the time required for developers and designers to iterate and refine their designs.

This tool enhances productivity by enabling the following:

1. **Rapid Iteration**: Developers can quickly iterate through different UI designs, making adjustments and improvements on-the-fly. With instant previews, they can assess the visual impact of their changes immediately.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Designers and stakeholders can gain immediate visual feedback on proposed UI designs, facilitating better collaboration and decision-making. This accelerates the design review process and ensures alignment with project goals.

3. **Efficient Troubleshooting**: When debugging UI issues, having a live preview helps identify and resolve problems more efficiently. Developers can instantly see how changes in code affect the appearance of the UI, speeding up the troubleshooting process.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing**: With the ability to preview UI across different devices and screen sizes, developers can ensure cross-platform compatibility more effectively. This helps identify any layout or responsiveness issues early in the development cycle.

5. **Educational Tool**: For learners or those new to web development, the previewer provides an interactive way to understand how HTML and CSS work together to create user interfaces. It offers a hands-on learning experience, allowing users to experiment with code and immediately see the results.

Overall, the `ChatGPT UI Preview` tool empowers developers and designers to visualize, iterate, and refine UI designs efficiently, ultimately speeding up the development process and improving the quality of the final product.
